===============================================================
1.It base on Opencv and Nao(a kind of robot,made in french) platform.</br>
2.I used Opencv2.4.9 and NaoqiSDK1.14.3 to build the whole project</br>
3.you'd better use the VS2010 IDE to build our project,because NAOqi1.14.3 did't support the standard of c++11.At the same time,you must have choregraphe1.14.3(the official developement tools with graphical interface)to open the crg files<br/>
4.It exist a lot shrotcomings and bugs,and our team will fix as soon as possiable</br>
5.If you want to use our code in research,please contact the NAO studio in DaLian Nation University Innovation and Education Center by E-mail.Our e-mail address is coder_xiao@163.com<br/>
